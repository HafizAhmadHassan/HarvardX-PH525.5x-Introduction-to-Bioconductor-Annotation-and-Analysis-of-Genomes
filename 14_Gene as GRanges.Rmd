## before video, run code from previous video AND these commands:


```{r}
res = findOverlaps(HepG2,GM12878)
erbs = HepG2[queryHits(res)]
erbs = granges(erbs)

```

# define human genes

```{r}
library(Homo.sapiens)
ghs = genes(Homo.sapiens)
ghs

```

# learn about the precede function (and related functions like follow)

```{r}
?precede

```

# for each range in erbs, find the closest preceding range in ghs

329145 is closest and preceds 361308

20335787 is closest and preceds 20251789 (-negative)
```{r}
index = precede(erbs, ghs)
ghs[index[1:3]]
erbs[1:3]    # note result is strand-aware

```
